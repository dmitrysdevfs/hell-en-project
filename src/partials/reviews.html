              In a short time with Elena, I mastered grammar and replenished my completely empty
              vocabulary. From the first lesson I realized that I was on my plate. Elena and I
              became friends because she was really worried about my success. She became an
              authority for me, but I did not tremble in class, fearing to make the slightest
              mistake. Now I can brag that I'm student who understands english and can speak it
              fluently and even write. thanks for this quality of work.
